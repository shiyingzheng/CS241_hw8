additup: adds up a sequence of integers, one integer per line

***********************************************
We have implemented functions to take care of 
NEGATIVE integers so that we can do:

$ ./additup
123
TOTAL: 123
-123
TOTAL: 0
-1234
TOTAL: -1234
-5
TOTAL: -1239
11111
TOTAL: 9872

Please consider giving us extra credits!
***********************************************

Addtional functions to take care of negative numbers are in bigint.c:
int bigint_abscmp (bigint * num1, bigint* num2);
bigint* minus (bigint* num1, bigint* num2);
